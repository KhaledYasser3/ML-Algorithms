# K-Means Clustering from Scratch

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm from scratch using Python. The goal is to provide an educational walkthrough of how the algorithm works internally, without relying on high-level libraries such as `scikit-learn`.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `k-mean-clustering-from-scratch.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and explanations for the algorithm.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure you have Python installed with the required libraries.
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

### Requirements

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## 📊 Features

- Random initialization of centroids
- Iterative update of cluster assignments and centroids
- Visualization of clustering results
- Example on synthetic dataset

## 📌 Notes

- This is a basic educational version and does not include optimizations.
- Designed to help beginners understand K-Means step-by-step.
