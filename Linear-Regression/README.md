# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** with **Scikit-learn** to predict laptop prices based on various features like processor, RAM, storage, etc. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used is `Laptop_price.csv`, which contains real or sample laptop specifications and their corresponding prices.

### Example Features:
- Brand
- Processor type
- RAM size
- Storage capacity
- Screen size
- Price (target)

## 📈 Goal

The goal is to train a regression model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its specifications.
