# Decision Tree Classifier

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using Python. The notebook explores building a classifier, visualizing the decision tree, and analyzing the performance of the model.

## Features
- Build a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn
- Evaluate and visualize the model
- Example usage with a dataset

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-classifier.git
cd decision-tree-classifier
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook decision-tree.ipynb
```

3. Run the notebook cells to see the results and visualizations.
